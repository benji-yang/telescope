The mission
The James Webb Space Telescope (Webb) is the next great space science observatory following Hubble, 
designed to answer outstanding questions about the Universe and to make breakthrough discoveries in all fields of astronomy. 
Webb will see farther into our origins: from the formation of stars and planets, to the birth of the first galaxies in the early Universe. 
Webb is an international partnership between NASA, ESA and CSA. 
The telescope launched on an Ariane 5 from Europe's Spaceport in French Guiana.
